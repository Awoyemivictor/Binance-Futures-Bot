* Works best with Python 3.8.10 on Linux.
* On Windows you may run into issues, using the docker file / reducing the number of coins you are trading might help
* Utilizes [python-Binance](https://python-binance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Client to execute orders and pull data from Binance
* Utilizes [ta](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for Technical indicators
* [Set up windows to sync time once a day](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/synchronise-computer-time-internet-custom-schedule-windows-7/#:~:text=Go%20to%20%3E%20Start%20and%20type,on%20the%20right%20hand%20side) if you don't do this binance will eventually reject orders with a timestamp error.

#### Creating Custom Strategies: ####
__Strategies are implemented in Bot_Class as functions in Make_decision()__
* ```Make_decision()``` must return ```Trade_Direction, stop_loss_val, take_profit_val``` for the strategy to work properly
* You might draw inspiration for a strategy from one of the samples in __TradingStrats.py__

* Whitelist your IP address to further secure your account, and so that your API keys don't expire after 3 months.
* Fill in your api keys into api_secret and api_key in __Config_File.py__

### For running Bot with cloud provider, Run directly from Live_Bot.py as you can't use the GUI through ssh ###
__Run strategies at your own risk I am not responsible for your trading decisions, futures are risky and proper risk management should be adhered to at all times, always have a stoploss__
```commandline
python3 Live_Bot.py
```
* Settings are in __Config_File.py__
* Trade a single position at a time by setting ```Number_Of_Trades = 1```, to trade multiple coins just increment this value.
* Choose the ```Interval``` you want to trade and the ```buffer``` of candlesticks your strategy will need this will be dependent on indicators you need to ensure you have a sufficient buffer, or you will get errors.
* ```leverage``` and ```order_Size``` should be changed according to your preference
* ```symbol[]``` is a list of the symbols you wish to trade, If you wish to trade all symbols set ```Trade_All_Coins = True```.
* __Trailing stop: set ```use_trailing_stop = 1``` and change ```trailing_stop_percent``` to suit your strategy to use the trailing stop (Min val .001 i.e .1%, Max 5 i.e. 5%). The trailing stop will be placed when the take profit value margin of increase/decrease is reached from your strategy__.
* To close a trade based off a condition check_close_pos() must return a close_pos flag.
* ```strategy``` is the name of the strategy you want to use, see below for adding your own custom strategies.
* There are 12 default strategies to choose from: StochRSIMACD, tripleEMAStochasticRSIATR, tripleEMA, breakout, stochBB, goldenCross,
candle_wick, fibMACD, EMA_cross, heikin_ashi_ema2, heikin_ashi_ema & ema_crossover
* ```TP_SL_choice``` correspond to the type of SL/TP seen in the dropdowns in the GUI see below for adding custom ones.
* ```SL_mult``` and ```TP_mult``` correspond to the numbers preceding the TP and SL choice dropdowns.

__Docker container creation__ (Recommended for anyone having issues running the bot):
* Navigate to the project directory in your terminal window
* Run the following Command this will create a docker image with the current state of your Config.py and choice of strategy in Bot_Class.py:

Sample docker commands that I use, __note yours may be different__ (`sudo` may not be needed for you, I am on Linux):
```shell
sudo docker build --tag live_bot .
sudo docker run -it live_bot
```

### GUI for Backtesting and Live Trading ###
__Just Run ```app.py``` to get the GUI__
```commandline

```
